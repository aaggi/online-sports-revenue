Sports clothing and athleisure attire is a huge industry, worth approximately $193 billion in 2021 with a strong growth forecast over the next decade!

In this notebook, I will undertake the role of a product analyst for an online sports clothing company. The company is specifically interested in how it can improve revenue. 
I will dive into product data such as pricing, reviews, descriptions, and ratings, as well as revenue and website traffic, to produce recommendations for its marketing and sales teams.
