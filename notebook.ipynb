The differences between the 'mean_rating' and 'description_length' are more or less the same for all the categories. The only outliers are the descriptions from 0-100 words, from 500-600 words and from 600-700 words. The first one is very low compared to the others, the second one is a bit lower than the others, and the last one is bit larger than the rest. The reason behind this distinction might be low number of reviews. The first one only has 7 reviews, the second and the third both have 15 reviews. So here a good or a bad reviews has a big influence. The results also show that the descriptions of length between 100–200-word, 200-300-words and 300-400-words gets by far the most amount of reviews. A simple explanation for this could be that there are more products that matches these description lengths.\n## Revenue between clothing and footwear\nIn this last section I'll analyze how the volume of products and median revenue vary between clothing and footwear. To do so I'll search for words associated with footwear, then find clothing items by excluding products returned in the original search. Then I'll to build a DataFrame with the volume of products and median revenue for each type.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c55d3992-8c75-4656-a859-74f37288f36b"},{"source":"# List of footwear keywords\nkeywords = 'shoe*|trainer*|foot*'\n\n# Creating footwear DataFrame\nfootwear = merged_df[merged_df['description'].str.contains(keywords)]\n\n# Creating clothing DataFrame\nclothing = merged_df[~merged_df.isin(footwear['product_id'])]\nclothing.dropna(inplace=True)\n\n# Creating the 'product_type' DataFrame\nproduct_types = pd.DataFrame({'num_clothing_products': len(clothing),\n                            'median_clothing_revenue': clothing['revenue'].median(),\n                            'num_footwear_products': len(footwear),\n                            'median_footwear_revenue': footwear['revenue'].median()},\n                           index=[0])\n\n# Showing the results\nproduct_types","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":56,"lastExecutedAt":1700518195468,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# List of footwear keywords\nkeywords = 'shoe*|trainer*|foot*'\n\n# Creating footwear DataFrame\nfootwear = merged_df[merged_df['description'].str.contains(keywords)]\n\n# Creating clothing DataFrame\nclothing = merged_df[~merged_df.isin(footwear['product_id'])]\nclothing.dropna(inplace=True)\n\n# Creating the 'product_type' DataFrame\nproduct_types = pd.DataFrame({'num_clothing_products': len(clothing),\n                            'median_clothing_revenue': clothing['revenue'].median(),\n                            'num_footwear_products': len(footwear),\n                            'median_footwear_revenue': footwear['revenue'].median()},\n                           index=[0])\n\n# Showing the results\nproduct_types","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":110,"type":"dataFrame"}}},"cell_type":"code","id":"aa09c00a-7e10-4257-85b2-6c47c3ef10db","execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v2+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"integer"},{"name":"num_clothing_products","type":"integer"},{"name":"median_clothing_revenue","type":"number"},{"name":"num_footwear_products","type":"integer"},{"name":"median_footwear_revenue","type":"number"}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":{"index":[0],"num_clothing_products":[478],"median_clothing_revenue":[625.07],"num_footwear_products":[2639],"median_footwear_revenue":[3073.3]}},"total_rows":1,"truncation_type":null},"text/plain":"   num_clothing_products  ...  median_footwear_revenue\n0                    478  ...                   3073.3\n\n[1 rows x 4 columns]","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>num_clothing_products</th>\n      <th>median_clothing_revenue</th>\n      <th>num_footwear_products</th>\n      <th>median_footwear_revenue</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>478</td>\n      <td>625.07</td>\n      <td>2639</td>\n      <td>3073.3</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"metadata":{},"execution_count":14}]},{"source":"## Clothing or Footwear?\nFrom the results of the analysis, we can see that there are 478 different pieces of clothing and 2639 different types of footwear. When we look at the median revenue for these two categories, then we get an idea of why there are a bigger revenue among the selection of footwear. Because the 'median_clothing_revenue' is only 625.07 in comparison to the 3073.3 for the 'median_footwear_renevue'.\n## Where do we go from here\nHow could we potentially use this analysis to optimize ‘our’ web shop? For the first part of the analysis, where we ask the question: ‘What is the volume of products and average revenue for Addias and Nike products based on listing price quartiles?'. This part of the analysis opens for further investigation in the products in each ‘price_label’-category. For example, should it be possible to reduce the numbers of Adidas products, since there is a lot of products in each category, and not all products can sell equally good. We might consider taking in more Nike product, since we have very few compared to Adidas. Especially products in the Average-category, since it has a pretty good ‘mean_revenue’, when we consider it only contains of 8 different products.\nFor the second question, the one about if there is a difference between the word count of a product's description and its mean rating. This part of the analysis we can use to improve the description of our products. From what we know now we can't tell, if there is a correlation between how many products we're selling and the length of the product description. It is what the preliminary analysis is indicating, but we need to investigate that further on. \nThe third and final question of this analysis was: 'How does the volume of products and median revenue vary between clothing and footwear?'. For further investigation regarding this question then we can for example use the analysis to look at the composition of the two types of products we are selling (clothing & footwear). For the footwear we can look the sells numbers for each product in this category and see if we can reduce the number of different shoes we're selling. For the clothing we can do the opposite and see if there any products in this category that we should have a bigger selection of.\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"75ee3b99-7b05-4ef7-963b-c2157393ccf1"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
